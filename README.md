# Forms-and-Form-Validation in React
This project demonstrates a React-based form with custom validation implemented using only React hooksâ€”no third-party libraries like Formik or Yup.

# Features:
User-friendly form UI with inputs for:
1. First Name & Last Name
2. Username
3. Email (with format validation)
4. Password (with show/hide toggle)
5. Phone Number (with country code)
6. Country & City (dropdowns)
7. PAN Number & Aadhar Number
8. Inline error messages for required and incorrectly formatted fields
9. Submit button is disabled until all validations pass
10. On successful submission, redirects to a confirmation page displaying all user input

# Tech Stack
- React (Functional Components)
- React Router for navigation
- Custom validation logic using useState and useEffect
